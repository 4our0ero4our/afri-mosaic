    history:
      "The Yoruba people have a long and complex history, with evidence of their presence in West Africa dating back to the first millennium BC. They established powerful kingdoms and city-states, such as Ife, Oyo, and Benin, which flourished for centuries. The Yoruba were renowned for their skilled craftsmanship, particularly in bronze casting, ivory carving, and pottery. Their art often depicted religious figures, ancestors, and scenes from daily life, reflecting their deep spiritual beliefs and cultural values.",
    traditions:
      "Yoruba traditions are deeply rooted in their religious beliefs and social structures. The Orishas, or deities, play a central role in Yoruba spirituality, with each deity associated with specific aspects of nature, human life, and morality. Traditional Yoruba society is organized into lineages and communities, with elders holding positions of authority and respect. Festivals and ceremonies are held throughout the year to honor the Orishas, celebrate important life events, and maintain social harmony.",

Yoruba art is highly valued for its aesthetic beauty and cultural significance, with pieces found in museums and private collections worldwide. The Yoruba language, music, and religious traditions have also spread to other parts of the world, particularly in the Americas, where they have blended with local cultures to create new forms of artistic and religious expression.",
